      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Ahmed-Beltagy/NYC-Taxi-Trip-Duration-Prediction">NYC-Taxi-Trip-Duration-Prediction</a></strong></li>
      <p>The objective is to design a model that can accurately predict the duration of a trip based on features such as the pick-up and drop-off locations or the date and time.  The goal of this challenge is to accurately predict the duration of taxi trips in New York City (NYC). The challenge provides two datasets: “train.csv”, and “test.csv”.  “train.csv” is the training set. It contains ground-truth labels and will be used to create and train the model. “test.csv” contains examples without labels. These labels are held hidden by Kaggle. Each example is identified by its unique id number, followed by the same features as the training set. We acheived an accuracy of 85% which is very good</p>
